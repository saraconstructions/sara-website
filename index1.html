									<small class="project-subtitle">A project in main land of "Rice bowl of Tamil Nadu", - Thanjavur</small>
									<p>Style of Moderne. Art deco comes from a variety of influences: Ancient Egypt, 1930s Hollywood and the tropical pastels of Miami Beach. Typical art deco structures have flat roofs, smooth stucco walls with rounded corners and bold exterior decorations. The style is used more often for office buildings than private homes.</p>

									<h3 class="project-title"><a href="#">Log Home</a></h3>
									<small class="project-subtitle">A project in chennai. Individual Bangalow Style </small>
									<p>Log homes originated as small cabins in the 1600s. Originally, they were built as one room using no nails, but now many log homes function as large luxurious getaways. Log homes can now be built in any location, but are most often found in a rural setting. However, the climate of the surrounding area dictates the type of wood that should be used to build the home. </p>

									<h3 class="project-title"><a href="#">Craftsman</a></h3>
									<small class="project-subtitle">A Project in Mangadu</small>
									<p>Bungalow and Craftsman style homes were born out of the Arts and Crafts Movement. The emphasis is on natural materials — wood, stone and brick. Wide front porches and low-pitched roofs are typical. The interior's open floor plan features built-in furniture, big fireplaces and exposed beams.</p>

									<h3 class="project-title"><a href="#">Modern</a></h3>
									<small class="project-subtitle">A project in chennai - Economic Zone</small>
									<p>Modern and contemporary styles tend to get confused. Modern architecture refers to design inspired by the historical art movement of modernism. Most classic examples of modern architecture are more than 50 years old, which makes it a little easier to tell a modern-style home from a contemporary-style home. Open living spaces, clean, geometric lines and function-over-form are key elements of the style.</p>

								<p>Our motto is Quality, Commitment and Performance.

The Scope of our Quality System is Planning, development, marketing and management of residential, commercial and Institutional layouts.

Prestige follows a Quality Management System hierarchy that is strictly abided by in all its residential and commercial properties in Bangalore and elsewhere. This system includes departmental guidelines and work instructions as well as essential directions for the quality management system from the top management, covering all requirements of ISO 9001:2000. To this effect, Quality Records are maintained methodically and carefully.

We ensure that wastage during construction is as low as 5%, thus providing optimum value for the client's money whether it is a commercial property investment or an individual who wants to buy an apartment or villa. We adopt latest technologies for safer, timely and reliable construction across all our properties in Bangalore and in other cities, giving you the best bet when you buy an apartment.

We encourage customer feedback and reviews so that corrective actions can immediately be put in place. Our Quality standards and procedures are periodically reviewed so as to maintain continuous improvement in all areas of activities based on customer inputs to enhance customer satisfaction.

Our aim is not restricted to being among the best Bangalore builders or in the country alone but also to be as environment friendly as possible. We address environmental safeguards and improvements in all our developments for the conservation and development of a greener and safer environment. </p>

												<p>After working with local website designers we had given up on ever competing with our big rivals. My son said we should go with a national company.... I was afraid of the cost. Turned out the cost was less expense and more compressive than any of the local designers. Since we came to Builder Designs our business has grown to 25M and we are winning local awards against our 200M and 5B competitors on both fronts! Thanks to Builder Designs who guides our team to ease of back end operation, we are current and relevant to the market.</p>
